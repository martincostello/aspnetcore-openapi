# ASP.NET Core ü§ù OpenAPI

[![Build status][build-badge]][build-status]

## Introduction

This sample project demonstrates three different ways that you can expose
[OpenAPI specifications][openapi] for ASP.NET Core applications:

1. [ASP.NET Core OpenAPI][aspnetcore-openapi]
1. [NSwag][nswag]
1. [Swasbuckle.AspNetCore][swashbuckle]

The sample application is a simple Todo list application that allows you to
create, read, update, and delete Todo items. The application is implemented
using ASP.NET Core 9.0 with Minimal APIs and Razor Pages.

## Building and Testing

Compiling the application yourself requires Git and the [.NET SDK][dotnet-sdk] to be installed.

To build and test the application locally from a terminal/command-line, run the
following set of commands:

```powershell
git clone https://github.com/martincostello/aspnetcore-openapi.git
cd aspnetcore-openapi
./build.ps1
```
